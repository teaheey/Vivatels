Making a website for my Dad's business

This is my very first project I make using Github. The reason for that is a necessity to make a programming product to graduate school.

As one of the first steps I decided to choose a free open-source template. The structure was more or less what I needed for my project.
Editing process started with index.html as it is my starting page, then I just move on to other pages.
Finally I am going to implement one more page named Gallery - to store some photos.
